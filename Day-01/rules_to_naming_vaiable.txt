Rule 1 :
Variable name should be meaningful, you can use single charaters such as "a", "b" only during methametical oprations, but try to avoid naming in such manner, example :
Dont use this type of variabele naming convetions ==> a = 12 , b = 12
instead of using this type of naming convetions for methametical operations use this ==> num_1 = 12, num_2 = 12, or you can use this too ==> firstNum = 12, secondNum = 12 

Rule 2 :
Variable name cannot start with number, example :
1name = "paras", 123 = "apple", never write your variable in such manner

Rule 3 :
A reserved keyword cannot be used as variable name, example :
this = 123, new = "chawal khay gi", break = 12.45, never write your varibales with such name

Rule 4 : 
Use usersocre (" _ ") while name your varibales if the variable is long, example : your_company_name = "paras techono", your_village_name = "palampur", this way of writing a variable name is also known as snake case


Rule 5 :
Use camel cases to name your variable, example : userName = "paras", userAge = 21, userPersonality = "eak dum dhasu"

Rule 6 :
Use pascal case to name your variable, example : MeraNam = "chun chun", MeraKam = "thun thun thun"

Rule 7 :
Never use Kebab case to name your variables, example : file-name = "hour glass", user-name = "Deepi", first-name = "tanisha", last-name = "sumi", this way of write a variable name is incorrect
